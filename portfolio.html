                Under the mentorship of Dr. William Gasarch, professor of computer science at University of Maryland. 
                Investigated the performance of 3SAT-solving algorithms under different conditions. This research 
                focused on 7Alg and a derivation of DPLL that selected the most frequent literal. Wrote the Java 
                implementation of these algorithms and then ran them thousands of times on different types of 3CNF formulae. 
                Completed a statistical analysis of the data collected using scatterplots and nonlinear regression lines 
                and wrote a research paper.

                Partnered with a client (a staff member from PHS) to create a mobile application that accesses a 
                regularly updated list of open hospitals. The app will direct Emergency First Responders to the 
                nearest available hospital with bedspace for the specific emergency. Solicited and documented 
                requirements, designed, programmed, tested, and delivered an application in accordance with iterative 
                software development processes and methodology. The app was developed using Android Studio to be 
                compatible with the Android OS. Emulated an Android device during testing.
